_this uLaunchELF mod was my first PS2 project._

It features:

- Timestamp manipulation feature to fix the date of any memory card folder containing any icon-based exploit _(\*tuna)_
- Extra file extensions for Text Editor ShortCuts
- ~`100kb` smaller that it´s original counterpart (wLE 41e4ebe) (this was possible thanks to CI with ps2dev:v1.0 toolchain)
- Support for PS3/PS4 Dualshocks thanks to Alex Parrado
#### this mod has proven to be excellent for HDD, USB and MC management.

> this mod is already bundled on any mod/project/repack made by me (and it´s auto-updated if that project is hosted here on github)

### Explanation of download filenames

> release filename change according to the enabled features, you may find the following words separated by `-` identifying with features that build has.
> you may also check this inside `MISC/BuildInfo` in case you have to rename the binary

- `BOOT`: Base filename, means nothing
- `UNC`: Executable is Uncompressed
- `COH`: Special version for PS2 `COH-H` Models (Namco System 246/256 specifically)
- `NO_NETWORK`: Network features are disabled and network IRX drivers stripped away, with the purpose of making app smaller
- `XFROM`: Support for accessing the [PSX-DESR](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fa/Console_psx.jpg) internal flash memory.
- `EXFAT`: Support for accessing EXFAT filesystems from BDM devices (USB & MX4SIO)
- `DS34`: Support for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 controllers over USB
- `MX4SIO`: Support for browsing the contents of SD Cards connected via [mx4sio](https://www.google.com/search?q=mx4sio)
- `MMCE`: Support for browsing the contents of the SDCard connected to MemcardPro2 or SD2PSX and their variants (make sure firmware of device is new enough to support the protocol)

### Build shortcuts

- `make all-ds34-off` builds a dedicated ELF without DS34 support.
- `make all-ds34-on` builds a dedicated ELF with DS34 support.
- `make all-ds34-variants` builds both variants in one run.
